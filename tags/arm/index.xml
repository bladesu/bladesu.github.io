      <description>Recently I try to make cross-compiling environment with library directory linked to target platform. In the end, not all library is recognized by CMake, however, it is a light-weight approach to build a application with cross-compiling.

This is a project that I try to make a cross-compile environment which link to libraries of targetâ€™s platform with sshfs in a light-weight docker container. I try to compile OpenCV 3.4.10 for the the target board PYNQ-Z2 with Xilinx XC7Z020-1CLG400C SOC.
First, I try to dig the toolchain applied in the board by gcc -v
xilinx@pynq:/usr/local/bin$ gcc -v Using built-in specs. COLLECT_GCC=gcc COLLECT_LTO_WRAPPER=/usr/lib/gcc/arm-linux-gnueabihf/7/lto-wrapper Target: arm-linux-gnueabihf Configured with: .</description>

      <title>Porting Qt libraries and application to ARM-based environment,</title>

      <description>Here I make a practice for application porting to ARM-based environment with leverage of docker container as build platform. This post contains not only application porting but also the Qt library. Finally I demonstrate the GUI application on a target platform(OrangePi, with sunxi H6 CPU) via VNC connection. Here is the link https://bladesu.github.io/learning/devops/cross_compilation/porting_app/qt_porting_orange_pi/.</description>

      <title>An cross-compiling exercise: porting Qt Application to ARM-base environment with docker environment. </title>

      <description>Recently I finish a exercise that porting Qt-based application from my development environment (Mac OS 10.13.6) to an ARM-based environment(Orange Pi with sunxi H6 SoC). Moreover, I create a docker container as cross-compiling environment with assigned toolchain for ARM.
If we want to run a Qt application on a machine with ARM CPU, we need to prepare built the libraries for Qt runtime. Not only the libraries but the application should be built with the ARM toolchain.</description>

      <description>Build once, run everywhere. Like Java language. Here comes a convenient way to write and deploy application with multiple CPU archtecture articultures attributed by integrated dockerized environments: Docker Desktop(after v2.1.0)
Prepare Docker environment: The environment in this demo I prepared:
 host os: macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 docker environment: integrated in docker desktop v2.1.0.5 (you can check stable release here:link)  Here we need to use docker buildx command, which is provided by docker desktop after v2.</description>

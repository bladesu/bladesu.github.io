      <description>Here I make a practice for application porting to ARM-based environment with leverage of docker container as build platform. This post contains not only application porting but also the Qt library. Finally I demonstrate the GUI application on a target platform(OrangePi, with sunxi H6 CPU) via VNC connection. Here is the link https://bladesu.github.io/learning/devops/cross_compilation/porting_app/qt_porting_orange_pi/.</description>

      <description>Recently I finish a exercise that porting Qt-based application from my development environment (Mac OS 10.13.6) to an ARM-based environment(Orange Pi with sunxi H6 SoC). Moreover, I create a docker container as cross-compiling environment with assigned toolchain for ARM.
If we want to run a Qt application on a machine with ARM CPU, we need to prepare built the libraries for Qt runtime. Not only the libraries but the application should be built with the ARM toolchain.</description>

      <description>Recently, I start to code a lot in c language. One of my studying material is &amp;ldquo;Head First C&amp;rdquo; written by David Griffith. And I am so confused about an example it talking about XOR encrption.
void encrpt(char *mes) { while (*mes) { *mes = *mes ^ 31; mes++; } } } This code could be compiled without any error or warning (Apple LLVM version 9.1.0 (clang-902.0.39.1)). But I am really curious about how XOR operator worker on the two operand *mes and the integer literal 31.</description>

Since I had connected to internect, I got a lot of knowlege from enormous amount of website. However it really hard to digest and organize all of them.
So I start this blog to put my idea and information collected. If I take something wrong, or you gain from something here. Please give me feedback, thank you.</description>
